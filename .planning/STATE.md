# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

Effect — no manual runtime wiring, no adapter boilerplate, just Effect returns
where you already write handlers.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [05-02]: In-memory Map for TodoService instead of Deno KV — simpler, no external dependencies
- [05-02]: Resolver default throws HttpError(500) with Cause in error.cause — enters Fresh error chain
- [05-02]: Example app mapError maps NotFoundError → HttpError(404) — bypasses Fresh dev overlay
- [05-02]: HttpError < 500 flows through segment error handler to _error.tsx without dev overlay

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

All resolved. See previous STATE.md versions for historical blockers.
